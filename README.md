This is `toss`, a command-line interface to the trash on Mac OS X, which provides an interface compatible with `rm(1)`.

The intention here is for toss to be a drop-in replacement for `rm` that moves items to the Trash folder instead of deleting them.

It is not complete yet. You shouldn't use it or replace `/bin/rm` with it quite yet.
